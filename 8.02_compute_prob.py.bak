"""
Exercise 8.2. Compute a probability.
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6
when drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval
[0, 1)? To answer this question empirically, let a program draw N such
random numbers using Pythonâ€™s standard random module, count how
many of them, M , that fall in the interval (0.5, 0.6), and compute the
probability as M/N . Run the program with the four values N = 10i
for i = 1, 2, 3, 6. Name of program file: compute_prob.py.
