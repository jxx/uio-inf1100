Exercise 8.9. Adjust the game in Exer. 8.8.
It turns out that the game in Exercise 8.8 is not fair, since you lose
money in the long run. The purpose of this exercise is to adjust the
winning award so that the game becomes fair, i.e., that you neither
lose nor win money in the long run.
Make a program that computes the probability p of getting a sum
less than s when rolling n dice. Use the reasoning in Chapter 8.3.2 to
find the award per game, r, that makes the game fair. Run the program
from Exercise 8.8 with this r on the command line and verify that the
game is now fair. Name of program file: sum_s_ndice_fair.py.
