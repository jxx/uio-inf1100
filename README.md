Exercises for INF1100 - Introduction to programming with scientific applications at UiO.

These are my notes and exercises from ["A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python"](http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-30292-3), by [H. P. Langtangen](https://github.com/hplgit). Thanks for a great class!

This is done to teach myself some Git basics. Many files are unfinished, some submitted exercises are not correct. Use at your own peril.
